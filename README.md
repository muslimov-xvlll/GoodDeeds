# Good Deeds — Android App (Java)

## 📌 Description
Good Deeds is an Android application designed as a personal "Book of Good Deeds".  
Users can record good actions they have completed in various categories such as **family**, **religion**, and others.  
The app includes a calendar that stores all user actions by date and category, allowing users to track their progress over time.

The project uses **Firebase Realtime Database** to store user data and includes a separate "Events" tab with **web parsing** of events from an external website. Users can view events and mark participation.

This project demonstrates experience with Android development, Firebase integration, data parsing, UI design, and working with external libraries.
